# BigBang
It's an open framework for deep learning.<br>
Alos It's a vs project(temporary, i think the project will support the linux system in the near feature).<br>

You need some tools for run the project.<br>
1.visual studio 2015(install from the offical website)<br>
2.cuda8.0(install from the offical website)<br>
3.protobuf(you should download the project in github and compile the project by the offical document,and then push the libprotobuf.lib and libprotobufd.lib into $Root/BigBang/depend/lib/protobuf/, if the path are not exist, create the folders)<br>
